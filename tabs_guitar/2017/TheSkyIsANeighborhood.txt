Em  B   G   A
C   Em  A


[Verse 1]
             Em           B G            A
The sky is a neighborhood,    so keep it down
C                Em        A              
  The heart is a storybook, a star burned out
             Em           B G              A
The sky is a neighborhood,    don't make a sound
C               Em        A              
  Lights coming up ahead, don't look now


[Pre-Chorus 1]
             Em           B  G  A
The sky is a neighborhood
             C            Em  A
The sky is a neighborhood,    don't look now


[Chorus 1]
Em          B                     G                   A
Oh my dear heaven is a big bang now, gotta get to sleep somehow
C                       Em                      A            G
Bangin' on the ceiling, bangin' on the ceiling, keep it down
Em          B                     G                   A
Oh my dear heaven is a big bang now, gotta get to sleep somehow
C                       Em                      A
Bangin' on the ceiling, bangin' on the ceiling, keep it down


[Verse 2]
Em              B          G            A
Mind is a battlefield, all hope is gone
C                        Em          A              
Trouble to the right and left, whose side you're on?
                          Em B       G            A
Thoughts like a minefield,     I'm a ticking bomb
C                           Em    A      
Maybe you should watch your step, don't get lost


[Pre-Chorus 2]
             Em           B  G  A
The sky is a neighborhood
             C            Em  A
The sky is a neighborhood,    don't get lost


[Chorus 2]
Em          B                     G                   A
Oh my dear heaven is a big bang now, gotta get to sleep somehow
C                       Em                      A            G
Bangin' on the ceiling, bangin' on the ceiling, keep it down
Em          B                     G                   A
Oh my dear heaven is a big bang now, gotta get to sleep somehow
C                       Em                      A
Bangin' on the ceiling, bangin' on the ceiling, keep it down

The sky is a neighborhood


[Verse 3]
    Em         B         G              A
The heart is a storybook, a star burned out
C                Em        A              
  Someone coming up ahead, don't look now


[Chorus 3]
Em          B                     G                   A
Oh my dear heaven is a big bang now, gotta get to sleep somehow
C                       Em                      A            G
Bangin' on the ceiling, bangin' on the ceiling, keep it down
Em          B                     G                   A
Oh my dear heaven is a big bang now, gotta get to sleep somehow
C                       Em                      A
Bangin' on the ceiling, bangin' on the ceiling, keep it down

The sky is a neighborhood

The sky is a neighborhood
