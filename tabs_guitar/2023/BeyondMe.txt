[Verse 1]
F#m       F#m
    If it all ended today
E             D
Would you be fine?
              A
Would you be fine?
       F#m
If it all ended this way
           E        D
Would you still be mine?
                     A
Would you still be mine?

Or, so I'm told
           A           Bm7          F#m
You must release what you hold dear
   E     D   A
Or so I fear
         E
Or so I fear

[Chorus]
Bm  C#m   D   A  E
But it's beyond me
        Bm  C#m   D   A  E
Forever young      and free

But it's beyond me

Forever young      and free

       F#m
If it all just went away

Would you be so kind?

Do tell

Do tell

Or so I fear
