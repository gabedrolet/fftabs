B E G F#m x2

[Verse]
B                 E
Where have you gone?
G
I walk in circles
F#               B
Back to square one
                E
Made it through yesterday
G                F#             B
Spilling wine, thinking of the time
               E
I wrote you a melody
G                  F#                   B
Rolling your eyes, I held your hand a while
              E
You need not say anything to me
   G                 F#
I hear you loud and clear
           G    F#7
Loud and clear

[Pre-Chorus]
B                                   Gmaj7 F#7
I’ll take care of everything from now on

[Chorus]
Bmaj7          E
Where are you now?
G                 F#m7
Who will show me how?
Bmaj7          E
Where are you now?
G                 F#m7
Who will show me how? 
Bmaj7          E
Wait for the sun
G           F#m            B
Say hello, maybe it will come
                 E
You watched the hummingbirds 
G             F#7
Naming every one
B               E
Do you have a minute for me?
G                   F#               B
If you don’t mind, I’ll be stopping by
                  E
To count all the little black clouds
     Gmaj7
But, don’t you worry
F#7                 G F#7
Please don’t worry

[Pre-Chorus]
B                                   Gmaj7 F#7
I’ll take care of everything from now on

Where are you now?

     I’ll take care of everything

I’ll take care of everything from now on

Where are you now?
Gmaj7             F#m7
Who will show me how?
Bmaj7          E
Where are you now?
G                F#7
Who will show me how?
                 (Who will show me how?)

Bmaj7          E
Where are you now?
