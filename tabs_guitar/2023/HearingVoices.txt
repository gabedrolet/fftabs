[Verse 1]
                     Dm  Dm7
I think I spoke too soon
              Gm
It's time to clear the air
                  Dm  Dm7
It's quiet in my room
                 Gm
The silence is unfair
                    Dm  Dm7
I've been hearing voices
                 Gm
None of them are you
                    Dm  Dm7
I've been hearing voices
                  Gm
None of them are you

[Pre-Chorus]
Bb5             F/A
Late at night I tell myself
C5                      G/B
Nothing this good could last forever
F#m               Bm
No one cries like you
F#m               Bm
No one cries like you

[Chorus]
Bb5                G5
I've been hearing voices
Bb5                G5
I've been hearing voices now
Bb5                G5
I've been hearing voices
                  Dm  Dm7
None of them arе you
                  Gm
None of them are you
                  Dm  Dm7
Nonе of them are you
                 Gm
None of them are you

[Verse 2]
                      Dm  Dm7
I've seen you in the room
                      Gm
I wish that you were here
                      Dm  Dm7
You promised me your words
                Gm
A whisper in my ear

[Pre-Chorus]
Bb5             F/A
Late at night I tell myself
C5                      G/B
Nothing this good could last forever
F#m               Bm
No one cries like you
F#m               Bm
No one cries like you
F#m               Bm
No one lies like you
F#m               Bm
No one lies like you

[Chorus]
Bb5                G5
I've been hearing voices
Bb5                G5
I've been hearing voices now
Bb5                G5
I've been hearing voices
                  Dm  Dm7
None of them arе you
                  Gm
None of them are you
                  Dm  Dm7
Nonе of them are you
                 Gm
None of them are you

[Outro]
Dm       Dm7    Gm
Speak to me my love
Dm       Dm7    Gm
Speak to me my love
                    Dm  Dm7
I've been hearing voices
                 Gm
None of them are you
                    Dm  Dm7
I've been hearing voices
                 Gm
None of them are you
Dm       Dm7    Gm
