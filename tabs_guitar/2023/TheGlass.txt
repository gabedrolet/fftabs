[Verse 1]
F#m       D            E              F#m
I had a vision of you, and just like that
       D                   A    D                   A
I was left to live without it, left to live without it
F#m        D              E              F#m
I found a version of love, and just like that
       D                   A    D                   A
I was left to live without it, left to live without it
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Bm                 E       F#m7
Waitin' for this storm to pass
Bm                 E       F#m7
Waitin' on this side of the glass
      G         D
But I see my reflection in you
G            D         Bm
See your reflection in me
             G
How could it be?
              D    A
How could it be?

[Chorus]
           G                D  A
There is somethin' between us
        G      F#m7 A
Between me and you
           G           F#m7
There is somethin' between us

I see right through
              D
I see right through

I had a version of home, and just like that
       D                   A    D                   A
I was left to live without it, left to live without it
F#m       D            E              F#m
I had a person I loved, and just like that
       D                   A    D                   A
I was left to live without it, left to live without it

See your reflection in me
             G
How could it be?

How could it be?
