[Intro]
D F#m G E

[Verse 1]
D                       F#m
Waking up, bottom of an empty cup
               G
Laying in your favorite clothes
             E
Chosen just for you
D                             F#m
Make you laugh, maybe I could make you laugh
               G
Books of faded photographs,
              E
Moments saved for you

[Verse 2]
D                          F#
Angel dust, turn to little papercuts
                 G
Close my eyes and feel your touch,
           E
Holding onto you

[Instrumental]
D F#m Bm G

[Chorus]
D              F#m
Rest, you can rest now
Bm                 G
Rest, you will be safe now
D              F#m
Rest, you can rest now
Bm                 G
Rest, you will be safe now

[Verse 3]
D                              F#
Love and trust, life is just a game of luck
               G                            E
All this time e-scaping us, until our time is through

[Instrumental]
D F#m Bm G

[Chorus]
D              F#m
Rest, you can rest now
Bm                 G
Rest, you will be safe now
D              F#m
Rest, you can rest now
Bm                 G
Rest, you will be safe now
D              F#m
Rest, you can rest now
Bm                 G
Rest, you will be safe now
D              F#m
Rest, you can rest now
Bm                 G
Rest, you will be safe now
             D
You will be safe now

[Instrumental]
F#m Bm G D x2

[Outro]
                       F#m
Waking up, had another dream of us
              G                         E
In the warm Virginia sun, there I will meet you
