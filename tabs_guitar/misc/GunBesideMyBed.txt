I'm sure one of you guys could modify this for the next part -
it switches to some kind of hammer-on or slide, then it does
the 2nd section again. After that, it switches to the build-up...

*Lyrics*

hold me now their is a sound not every single one loves. 
there's a time when i will sound how are you now my lover.
you're changing it, you change again.
round and round you put it down my head.

he's around dont put him down now she's on everyone list.
call it down it charts a sound now everyone is wondering.
your changing it, you change again.
round and round you put it in my head. 

hold you like the gun beside my bed.
hold you like the gun beside my bed.
hold you like the gun beside my bed.
two strangers, not in love. 

when your down you pass around now any single wonders
trance around our lives are bound and all you do is wonder.
your drinking it, you drink again.
round and round the fool is in my head 

hold you like the gun beside my bed.
hold you like the gun beside my bed.
hold you like the gun beside my bed.
two strangers, now or later, their in love. 

you're changing it, you change again, 
pull me down their sound i hear again. 

all around they pull a sound not every single will love.
helping out the way you know now all is all that matters.
you change, and then, you change again.
round and round their pulling down my head. 

hold you like the gun beside my bed.
hold you like the gun beside my bed.
hold you like the gun beside my bed.
two strangers, now in. 

hold you like the gun beside my bed.
hold you like the gun beside my bed.
hold you like the gun beside my bed.
we're two strangers, now and later, 
we're two strangers, now and later, not in love.
