Verse -

D
Every night my dream's the same.
Same old city with a different name.
G
Men are coming to take me away.
D
I don't know why but I know I can't stay.

D
There's a weight that's pressing down.
Late at night you can hear the sound.
G
Even the noise you make when you sleep.
D
Can't swim across a river so deep.

Chorus -

A                                 D
They know my name 'cause I told it to them,
     D
But they don't know where And they don't know
A                                                    D 
When It's coming, when It's coming.

Verse #2 -

D
There's a fear I keep so deep,
Knew its name since before I could speak
G                                        D
Oooh   Oooh  Oooh  Ooooh

Chorus -

A
They know my name 'cause I told it to them,
   D
But they don't know where And they don't know
G                        D                                  G
When It's coming, Oh! when It's coming
                    D
Keep the car running

Verse #3 -

D
If some night I don't come home,
Please don't think I've left you alone.
           G
The same place animals go when they die,
D
You can't climb across a mountain so high.
            G
The same city where I go when I sleep,
D
You can't swim across a river so deep.

Chorus

A                                D
They know my name 'cause I told it to them,
D
But they don't know where
And they don't know
              G                D                   G
When It's coming, Oh! when is it coming?

Outro - 
                   D           G
Keep the car running
                  D            G
Keep the car running
                 D             G
Keep the car running
