intro: G    D   Am Asus2   Em  C   D Dsus4  x2


G                                          Cadd9
I can’t wait to get there, and see what was left there of you
Am                                D
pick through the pieces, I can’t resist it
G                             Cadd9
set from the get-go, knew it was over before
Am                              D
we hit that first chord, all out of tune


G                                     Cadd9
so what did ya think was gonna happen
G                                          Cadd9
you were just the ghost of a bad habit
G                             Cadd9
where is the blood, where is the passion?
G                     Cadd9                  D
I got lost on a bad reaction to you


G                                 Cadd9
point dirty fingers, it’s everybody’s fault when
Am                  D
history lingers, history leaves little doubt
G                                         Cadd9
but gives me a treason, but I gave you the truth
 Am                              D
you gave me reasons, a pitiful excuse


G                                     Cadd9
so what did ya think was gonna happen
G                                          Cadd9
you were just the ghost of a bad habit
G                             Cadd9
where is the blood, where is the passion?
G                     Cadd9                  D
I got lost on a bad reaction to you

             G  D  Am
oh that’s it
           Asus2             Em   C   D Dsus4
do you remember the reasons?
                        G     D   Am                   
where’s the passion?
Asus2           Em   C  D Dsus4
where is the fire?
